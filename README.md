# PAMPA

__PAMPA (Protein Analysis by Mass Spectrometry for Ancient Species)__ is a versatile software suite tailored to effectively handle various tasks associated with ZooMS (Zooarchaeology by Mass Spectrometry) data and peptide markers.

It consists of two primary scripts: 
  - PAMPA CLASSIFY:  fast and easy species identification from mass spectra using peptide markers. 
  - PAMPA CRAFT: creation of custom set of peptide markers.
